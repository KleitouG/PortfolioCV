            <p>With a foundation in classical education from Lyceum, coupled with extensive experience in customer service and a
                Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, I have cultivated a diverse and robust skill set. My classical education has
                provided me with critical thinking skills and a strong analytical foundation, while my customer service experience has
                honed my communication abilities and equipped me with the skills to handle high-pressure situations with
                professionalism and grace. Furthermore, my academic background in Software Engineering has given me a deep
                understanding of technology, programming, and software development. These varied experiences have not only
                enhanced my technical and interpersonal skills but have also enabled me to adapt seamlessly to different work
                environments and thrive in any professional setting. I am confident that these attributes position me well to contribute
                effectively to any team or organization.
